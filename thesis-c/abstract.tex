\chapter*{Abstract}\label{abstract}

This report provides an overview of the development of real-time systems. It then considers a model
and system that can be used to develop static and dynamic real-time systems that satisfy not only
real-time requirements, but also requirements of criticality and security. It extends on previous
work using the seL4 microkernel to build a general-purpose platform for real-time systems.
