\chapter*{Abstract}\label{abstract}

This report provides an overview of strategies used to guarantee the
timing behaviour of hard and mixed-criticality realtime systems. It then
proposes a set of changes the the MCS seL4 extensions that ensure the
kernel-level scheduler can guarantee the assumptions made by common
timing analysis processes for fixed-priority scheduling.
